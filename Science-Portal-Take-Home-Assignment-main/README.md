## Overview

This project is a take-home assignment. The goal is to refactor an existing carousel component into a more structured layout with individual components.

The intention is that this would take no more than 1 hour. If you can't complete the task in that time, please submit what you have. We will not penalize any submission for being incomplete and we will judge all submissions according to their quality. Intentions for any partially completed code can be clarified in the follow-up interview.

## Project Structure

A successful submission will meet the following criteria:

1. Break out the individual carousel slides into separate components.
