            A successful submission will be one where the individual carousel slides have been broken out accordingly.


            The slides should be broken out in a manner that extracts the first slide into its own component and has it displayed prominently above the other slides. The other slides should be converted into a general card component, which when clicked reveals the associated text as dropdown text. These card components should be arranged in a grid layout.

             Refer to the README.md for further detail.
